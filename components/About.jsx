            Hi there! My name is Nay Zaw Thant, and I am a Web Developer with expertise in a wide range of programming languages and technologies.
            Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task.
            I am currently working at a Software House in Yangon, where I have honed my skills and gained valuable experience in building responsive, user-friendly websites and applications.
            My programming skills include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js,
            Redux, Nodejs, Next.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, and Git. I am constantly looking for ways to expand my skillset and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and developments.
            I am a self-motivated learner and a skilled problem solver, with a proven track record of building successful ecommerce websites,
            blog websites, and custom web applications. I thrive in a collaborative team environment and am always looking for ways to contribute my skills and expertise to help my colleagues achieve their goals.
            Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to your team!
          </p>
